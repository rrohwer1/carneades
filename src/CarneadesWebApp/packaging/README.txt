Prerequisites
 - Version 7 or better of a [Java Runtime Environment (JRE 7)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
 - Recent version of a standards-compliant Web Browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Safari).

To install and run the Carneades Web Application:

1. Unzip the carneades-webapp.zip file.
2. Change to the carneades-webapp directory
3. Double click on the carneades-webapp.jar file
4. Alteratively, execute the following command line:

   $ java -jar carneades-webapp.jar

5. The server will be start and open the home page of the
   Carneades client in your web browser.

6. If the home page fails to open, enter this URL into the
   address bar of your web browser:

   http://localhost:8080/carneades/#/home

7. To shutdown the server you may need to end the Java task using your task manager,
   depending on your operating system.  If you started the server from the command line,
   you can kill the process with Control-C on Unix machines, including Macs.  If you
   started the server on a Mac by double clicking on the jar file, you can shutdown the
   server by quitting the "routes_selfexe" application in the usual way, with Command-Q.
